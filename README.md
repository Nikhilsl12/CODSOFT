# CODSOFT Virtual Internship

This repository contains the solutions for the tasks completed during the CODSOFT Virtual Internship. The internship consisted of three tasks: Number Game, Student Grade Calculator, and ATM Interface.

## Number Game
The Number Game task involved creating a program that generates a random number and allows the user to guess the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

## Student Grade Calculator
The Student Grade Calculator task required developing a program that calculates the average grade for a list of students. The program takes input for each student's grades and calculates their average grade.

## ATM Interface
The ATM Interface task involved creating a user-friendly interface for an ATM machine. The interface allows users to perform various banking operations such as withdrawing money, checking account balance, and transferring funds.

Each task is implemented as a separate module within this repository.
