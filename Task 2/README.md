# Student Grade Calculator
## Description
The Student Grade Calculator is a Java program that calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade of a student based on the marks entered for each subject. The program prompts the user to input the number of subjects and the marks obtained in each subject. It then calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage.

## Features
- Input the number of subjects.
- Input marks for each subject (out of 100).
- Calculates total marks.
- Calculates average percentage.
- Assigns a grade based on the average percentage:
    - A for average percentage > 90
    - B for average percentage > 70 and <= 90
    - C for average percentage > 50 and <= 70
    - D for average percentage > 30 and <= 50
    - F for average percentage <= 30

## Usage
Follow the on-screen prompts:
1. Enter the number of subjects.
2. Enter the marks for each subject (between 0 and 100).
3. The program will display the total subjects, total marks, percentage, and grade.

### Notes
- Ensure that the number of subjects entered is greater than zero.
- Marks for each subject should be between 0 and 100. If invalid marks are entered, the program will prompt to re-enter the marks for that subject.
